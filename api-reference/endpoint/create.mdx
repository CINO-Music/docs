### 🔮 Overview of PROs

- **🇺🇸 US PROs**
    
    ### 🎤 **Performing rights:**
    
    **ASCAP** „American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers“
    
    > *The only American PRO created and controlled by composers, writers, and music publishers. ASCAP’s board of directors is elected by its members. Along with BMI, it is another one of the largest PROs in the United States. It also collects performance royalties outside the U.S. via reciprocal agreements with foreign PROs.*
    > 
    
    **BMI** “Broadcast Music Incorporated”
    
    > *BMI is one of the biggest and most well-known PROs in the U.S. It was founded by radio executives to “serve as an advocate for the value of music” and “support its songwriters, composers, and publishers by taking care of an important aspect of their careers — getting paid.” They offer [blanket music licenses](https://help.songtrust.com/knowledge/what-is-a-blanket-license) to businesses and organizations that allow them to play more than 17 million musical works. A common example would be the blanket licenses that [let radio stations](https://blog.songtrust.com/what-you-didnt-know-about-radio-royalties) play a wide range of music legally. Other common blanket license clients include TV networks, nightclubs, and film production companies.*
    > 
    
    **SESAC** „Society of European Stage Authors & Composers“
    
    > *****SESAC is a relatively small PRO that is open by invitation only. It focuses on film and television composers from such hit TV shows as Seinfeld, How I Met Your Mother, and Grey’s Anatomy, and major songwriters like Mariah Carey, Neil Diamond, Adele, and Bob Dylan. SESAC also owns and works alongside the Harry Fox Agency.*
    > 
    
    **GMR** “Global Music Rights”
    
    > *Global Music Rights was founded by industry veteran Irving Azoff as an alternative to the traditional performance rights model. It prides itself on being the first new U.S. PRO in nearly 75 years — an active, progressive advocate for copyright holders in the current marketplace. They are committed to protecting the integrity of music rights and promoting the value of intellectual property on behalf of creators. GMR serves a select client base, creating customized solutions and personalized services for writers.*
    > 
    
    ### ⚙️ **Mechanical rights:**
    
    MLC “Mechanical Licensing Collective”
    
    > *The Mechanical Licensing Collective is a nonprofit organization created by the [Music Modernization Act](https://blog.songtrust.com/songtrust-the-mma-and-you) to administer blanket mechanical licenses to eligible streaming services in the U.S. and pay the resulting royalties to songwriters, composers, lyricists, and music publishers. It is designated by the [U.S. Copyright Office](https://www.songtrust.com/music-publishing-glossary/glossary-US-copyright-office) and [endorsed](https://www.nashvillesongwriters.com/music-licensing-collective-mlc-coalition-unveils-broad-support-copyright-office-submission) by the National Music Publishers’ Association ([NMPA](http://nmpa.org/)), the Nashville Songwriters Association International ([NSAI](https://www.nashvillesongwriters.com/)), and the Songwriters of North America ([SONA](https://www.wearesona.com/)). If you’re signed up with Songtrust, we register your songs with The MLC on your behalf, along with pay sources in 215 countries and territories around the world.*
    > 
    
    **HFA** “Harry Fox Agency”
    
    > *The Harry Fox Agency meets the mechanical and digital licensing needs of nearly 50,000 affiliated publishers, more than 2,500 record labels, and several major [Digital Service Providers](https://help.songtrust.com/knowledge/what-is-a-digital-service-provider-dsp) (DSPs). HFA issues mechanical licenses and collects and distributes mechanical royalties on behalf of their affiliated publishers. This includes licensing for the recording and reproduction of CDs, ringtones, and digital downloads. HFA also conducts royalty examinations, negotiates new business opportunities, and pursues key piracy claims.*
    > 
    
    **MRI** “Music Reports”
    
    > *Music Reports was originally introduced as an alternative to the rigid blanket licensing structures of BMI and ASCAP. MRI developed an administration service that allows composers of television to license their works to local television stations directly. The company is now a leader in music rights clearances, licensing solutions, and mechanical royalty accounting for digital and background music services such as Amazon, Deezer, Flipagram, Pandora, iHeartMedia, SiriusXM, SoundCloud, and Tidal.*

# 👩‍🎤 The Look

This one’s not about the look of yourself as an artist, but rather about how you present that look to your fans and the public with all assets needed as a foundation to make a release happen. Let’s dive into the facade of your digital appearance:

- **🖼 Artwork**
    
    When choosing an artwork for your single, there are a few different things to consider. Let’s have a look, shall we?
    
    **Does it fit your CI?** 💅
    
    By now, you’ve probably thought about your CI a little bit. And if you haven’t - log off right   now, sit with a pen and paper and think about your brand! For all of you that are still here, you are probably aware that your artwork should work with your CI. That doesn’t mean it should be only the two colors you used on your website, or there can’t be anything extraordinary on it. But you need have thought about what you want to represent with this single and what is going to work well with upcoming releases as well. You don’t want the cover for every single to look like they were released by a different artist - unless that is exactly the strategy you are following, in that case, go crazy. As long as there is thought and reason behind it, anything goes.
    
    **Dont’s 🙅‍♀️**
    
    Whoops, not *anything* anything, of course. For some distributors, can’t be any contact information on your artwork, or suggestions of the format of the release (e.g. ”Digital Exclusive”). And of course, please only use images you have the right to use. 
    
    **Digital Media Specs 🔧**
    
    - TIFF, PNG, or JPG format using lossless encoding
    - The highest resolution available
    - At least 640px wide and tall (you will do well with many DIY distributors if your artwork is 3000x3000px or 4000x4000px)
    - 1:1 aspect ratio
    - Encoded with an sRGB color space, 24bits per pixel, with color profiles applied directly
    
- **📸 Press photos**
    
    We are going to get into the dirty details of a good press photo a bit further down, but for now, I’m just giving you this lil checklist about the kind of pics you need to have prepared. 
    
    - 1 vertical full body shot
    - 1 vertical shot from the waist up
    - 1 horizontal shot from the waist up
    - 2 alternative pics
    
- **🪧 Banner (Spotify, Facebook media specs)**
    
    You thought we were done with the visuals? Oh no, we are only just getting started! Welcome to the world of social media, where your banner/header picture speaks volumes. If it's not in the right format, you might as well be wearing mismatched socks to a gala. The dance of different screen sizes and resolutions demands pixel-perfect choreography. Your image has a split second to impress, so pixelation is a no-no. The right format isn't just tech talk – it's your digital charm that beckons your audience to dive deeper. So let’s have a look at the correct specs!
    
    **Spotify**
    
    - Min. 2660px x 1140px
    - Better: 6000px x 4000px
    - Not bigger then 20 MB
    - .jpeg, .png, or .gif
    
    **Facebook**
    
    - 820 x 312 pixels desktop
    - 640x360 pixels mobile
    
    **YouTube**
    
    - Min. 2048 x 1152px
    - Better: 2560 x 1440px
    - Not bigger than 6MB
    - .jpeg, .png, .gif, .bmp
    
- **👩‍🦱 Profile Pics (media specs)**
    
    Your profile pic is your digital welcome mat. A pixelated mess is like greeting guests in pajamas. Just as you wouldn't rock up to a job interview in flip-flops, your profile pic shouldn't defy media specs. It's your visual handshake; make sure it's pixel-perfect
    
    **Spotify**
    
    - 750 x 750px
    - .jpeg, .png, .gif
    - Not bigger than 20MB
    
    **Facebook**
    
    - Min. 180 x 180px
    - Better: 360x360px
    - Not bigger than 100KB
    - Ideally .jpeg
    
    **YouTube**
    
    - 800 x 800px
    - .jpeg, .png, .gif, .bmp
    - Not bigger than 2MB
    
- 🎨 **Canvas**
    
    Alright, imagine your favorite album and a quirky art gallery colliding – that's Spotify Canvas. It's like an album cover on caffeine, bringing your music to life with funky visuals. If your song is a cool cat, then Canvas is its groovy dance move. It's not just about the beats anymore; it's about the visual treats too. 
    
    So, why's it important? Because in the marathon of attention-grabbing, having your music strut its stuff in style can make listeners boogie for more. Just think of it as your track's snazzy makeover – turning plain old audio into a full-blown audio-visual fiesta! And of course, I got your back - here are the media specs:
    
    **Spotify Canvas**
    
    - 3-8 seconds long
    - Vertical 9:16 ratio
    - Between 720px - 1080px tall
    - An MP4 file
    
    [**🔗 Learn more about Spotify Canvas**](https://canvas.spotify.com/)
    

### 💪 **To-Do list**

- [ ]  Choose or shoot artwork, add text if needed
- [ ]  Make sure you have the necessary press photos
- [ ]  Choose or shoot banners, make sure you have the right media specs for each plattform
- [ ]  Choose or shoot banners, make sure you have the right media specs for each plattform

## 🔀 Song Submission

Let’s say you’ve been an awesome student and you’ve researched your favorite distributor and signed up with them. Now the really important (and fun) part starts: 
I**t is time to submit your song to the distributor!** 🎉

Do this **4 weeks prior** to the release to make sure everything runs smoothly and there is enough time left to pitch. You distributor will usually walk you through their submission process on their website, but let’s have a look at the assets information you need to have ready if you want to submit: 

- Song mastered to perfection
- Artwork
- Title of the song
- Contributors
- Timecode of the preview snippet
- Lyrics (for some distributors)

### 💅 Claiming your artist profile

It’s the first time you release a song and you wonder how to claim your profiles on streaming services?

No worries, your distributor will send you instructions on how to claim profiles on the different services right before your release. If you don’t want to wait, here are the relevant links for various streaming services:

- [Spotify artist profile](https://artists.spotify.com/claim)
- [Apple Music artist profile](https://artists.apple.com/support/1101-claim-your-account)
- [Deezer artist profile](https://creatorsupport.deezer.com/hc/en-us/articles/6328093844893-How-To-Get-Access-To-Deezer-For-Creators)
- [Tidal artist profile](https://tidal.com/forartists)
- [Soundcloud artist profile](https://artists.soundcloud.com/)

## 🚀 Song pitch

Well done, you’ve successfully submitted your song! But that doesn’t mean it’s time to take a break. Let’s get to pitching. Some distributors offer add-on pitching services you can buy. If you don’t want to do that, you can pitch your song to Spotify using Spotify for Artists. They have an extra pitching tool in which you input your song, its mood, instrument, theme, and a short single bio. Make it snappy and put in as much information as you can. The more they know about the song, the easier for them to put it into playlists. But careful: if you do book your distributor’s pitching service, make sure not to pitch yourself.

# 🗂 The EPK

## ☝️Definition EPK

An EPK, or "Electronic Press Kit", is basically a digital package that you put together to show off your amazing skills to all the media reps, event organizers, and anyone else who's interested in your work. Think of it as your time to shine like a star and say, "Hey, check me out! I'm awesome and you know it!" It's your chance to make sure everyone knows just how amazing you are and get your name out there in the media. So don't be shy, put on your confident smile, and let's rock and roll with that EPK!

You can create it as a website or digital document and share it on your official website, social media platforms, or even send it directly to interested parties. Its purpose is to provide all the necessary information to media representatives and other contacts so they can report on or book you and your awesome skills!

## 🙋‍♀️ Why it’s needed

Ah, the burning question: Why do you need an EPK, you wonder? Well, slow down young child. Think of it like this – you're not just a star; you're a whole constellation waiting to burst into the night sky. An EPK becomes your trusty spaceship, navigating the digital cosmos, packed with all the evidence of your awesomeness.

Picture this: media moguls, event organizers, and those intrigued souls out there are dying for a backstage pass to your world. They want the scoop on your journey, the visuals that'll make their eyes pop, and the creations that'll leave them speechless. Your EPK is your gift to them – a digital wonderland where they can ogle your magazine-worthy photos, groove to your award-worthy tunes, and get lost in videos that could rival blockbuster hits.

But that's not where the story ends! Your EPK is the golden ticket to your own superstar realm. With press releases that could be mistaken for art, news flashes juicier than a celebrity scandal, and a list of accomplishments longer than a giraffe's neck, you're basically the talk of the universe.

So, why do you need an EPK? Because you're not just a star; you're a force of nature, a whirlwind of talent and charisma, and the world deserves a front-row seat to your spectacle. It's like shouting to the cosmos, "Hey world, get ready to be amazed by the sheer fabulousness that is **you**!" 🚀🌟

## 🎬 Content of an EPK

An EPK, or Electronic Press Kit, is like your digital superstar portfolio in the music industry. It's a way to showcase your amazing skills and talents to media reps, event organizers, and anyone else who wants to know more about you and your music.

Think of it as your time to shine and say, "Hey, check me out! I'm awesome and you know it!" It's your chance to make sure everyone knows just how incredible you are and get your name out there in the media.

You can create your EPK as a website or a digital document and share it on your official website, social media platforms, or even send it directly to interested parties. The purpose of an EPK is to provide all the necessary information to media representatives and other contacts so they can report on or book you and your awesome music!

Remember, your EPK is your ticket to standing out in the music industry. It's your chance to show the world what makes you special and why they should pay attention to your music. So, get creative, be authentic, and let your talent shine through in your EPK!

Your EPK should include a range of content that showcases your talents and achievements. This can include things like:

- **🪦 Artist Biography**
    
    Alright, let's break it down! In the music biz, an artist biography is like your musical résumé with a side of pizzazz. It's the scoop on your life, your journey to stardom, and all the rad stuff you've pulled off along the way. Here are some tips to rock it:
    
    1. **Short and Sassy** 💅
    Keep it brief and snappy. Think elevator pitch, not a novel.
    2. **Show That Flair** ✨
    Highlight what makes you, well, you! Whether it's your funky beats, lyrical genius, or the fact that you play air guitar in your sleep.
    3. **Brag a Bit** 😎
    Let your victories shine – albums dropped, sold-out shows, or that one time you rocked a gig in your PJs.
    4. **Stay Fresh** 🥵
    Keep your bio up-to-date. No one wants to read about the demo you made in high school (unless it's hilariously bad).

To make some killer music and show the world what we're made of. So, it goes without saying that you need to have your songs featured front and center in your EPK.
    
    Now, let's talk about how to do this right:
    
    1. **How to link 🔗**
    You want to make sure you're linking to your songs in the best way possible. That means using cloud or download links that are easy to access and download. Ain't nobody got time for complicated or broken links. So, keep it simple and make sure your links work like a charm.
    2. **What to link** 🎧
    You want to choose the right songs to feature in your EPK. If you're creating an EPK for a release, then obviously your upcoming single needs to be front and center. But, if you're creating an EPK for general promotion, then you want to choose the songs that best represent you as an artist and have been the most successful for you. It's all about showcasing your unique style and sound.
    
- **🏛 Discography & References**
    
    Alright, let's get real for a sec - your discography and references are like your musical resume, but with way more swagger.

    Here are three tips to make your discography and references pop:
    
    1. **Stay fresh 👩‍💻** 
    Keep your discography and references up to date. No one wants to see that demo you made in high school (unless it's hilariously bad and you've got some great stories to tell).
    2. **Choose wisely** 🧙‍♂️
    Pick the releases and collaborations that showcase your musical genius and vibe the best. Don't be afraid to highlight the collaborations that make you look like the superstar you are.
    3. **Connect the dots** 🗺
    Link your discography and references to other parts of your EPK, like your music links or press photos. This way, people can see how all the pieces fit together to present you as the epic artist you are.
    
    So go ahead, flex that discography and references like the musical badass you are. You got this, rockstar!
    
- **🌐 Socials**
    
    Links to your social media profiles are a crucial part of your EPK. They give potential fans and industry reps a chance to get to know you and your music better and stay up-to-date on all your latest happenings. With just one click, they can jump straight to your profiles and get a feel for your style, personality, and sound.
    
    But here's the kicker: linking to your social media profiles can also help you grow your fanbase and increase your reach. By linking to your profiles on different platforms, you can reach more people and get your music in front of a wider audience.
    
    So, without further ado, here are five social profiles that absolutely need to be included in your EPK:
    
    1. **Website** 🌎
    Your website is your digital home base and should be the centerpiece of your EPK. This is where fans can learn more about you, listen to your music, and check out your tour dates. Make sure you include a direct link to your website in your EPK.
    2. **Digital Streaming Platform** 🎧
    These days, lots of people listen to music on digital streaming platforms like Spotify or Apple Music. It's important to include links to your profiles on these platforms so that fans can stream and share your music.
    3. **Instagram** 🏞
    Instagram is one of the most important social media platforms for musicians. This is where you can share photos and videos of your music, performances, and life. Make sure you link your Instagram profile in your EPK so that fans can follow you and stay up-to-date.
    4. **TikTok** 🤳
    TikTok is a rising star in the social media world, especially among younger audiences. This is where you can share short videos of your music and life and build a new fanbase. Make sure you link your TikTok profile in your EPK to reach this audience.
    5. **YouTube** ▶️
    YouTube is the second-largest search engine in the world and an important channel for sharing music videos and live performances. Make sure you link your YouTube profile in your EPK to give fans access to your videos and increase your reach.

- **🗓 Tourdates / Upcoming events**
    
    Not only do tour dates and upcoming events give fans a chance to see you live and experience your music in person, but they also show industry reps that you're serious about your career and have a plan in place. It's like saying, "Hey, I'm not just a one-hit wonder - I'm in this for the long haul, and I've got the gigs to prove it!"
    
    So, what are some tips for including tour dates and upcoming events in your EPK? Here are three to get you started:
    
    1. **Be specific** 📍
    Don't just say "touring this summer" - give fans and industry reps specific dates and locations so they can plan accordingly and know when you'll be in their area.
    2. **Include ticket links** 🎟
    Make it easy for fans to buy tickets to your shows by including links to where they can purchase them. This also shows industry reps that you're organized and professional.
    3. **Update regularly** 🗓
    Keep your tour dates and upcoming events up-to-date and accurate, so fans and industry reps know exactly what you're up to and can plan accordingly.
    
- 👥 **Contact Info**
    
    Let's talk about the importance of contact info in your EPK. I mean, you're not just making music for the squirrels in your backyard, right? You want people to hear your tunes, book you for gigs, and maybe even offer you a record deal. And how are they going to do that if they can't even find your contact info?
    
    So, listen up and listen good. Your contact info is like the cherry on top of your EPK sundae. It's the sweet, juicy goodness that people need to get in touch with you and make magical things happen.
    
    So, make sure your contact info is up-to-date, easy to find, and accurate. Include:
    
    - **your email address 📮**
    - **your phone number ☎️**
    
    Or, if you have a management, booking, product manager etc, include their contact info.
    
    And hey, who knows? Maybe you'll get a call from Beyoncé herself, asking you to collaborate on her next album. Okay, maybe that's a stretch. But you never know who might be on the other end of that email or phone call. So, make sure your contact info is on point and get ready to rock and roll! 🤘
